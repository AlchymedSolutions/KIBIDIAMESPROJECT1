# Report: Factors Influencing House Prices in Ames, Iowa

## i. What factors influence house prices most?

Based on exploratory data analysis and correlation metrics, the strongest predictors of `SalePrice` are:

| Variable | Pearson Correlation | Spearman Correlation | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `Overall Qual` | 0.799 | 0.809 | Overall material/finish quality is the single strongest predictor |
| `Gr Liv Area` | 0.707 | 0.723 | Above-ground living area (sq ft) shows strong positive association |
| `Total Bsmt SF` | 0.681 | 0.681 | Total basement square footage correlates well with price |
| `Garage Area` | ~0.62* | ~0.62* | Larger garages associate with higher prices (*value inferred from context) |
| `Year Built` | 0.558 | — | Newer homes tend to sell for more, though relationship is weaker |

**Key Insight**: Quality ratings (`Overall Qual`) matter more than raw size metrics. A well-finished smaller home can outprice a larger but lower-quality property. The multiple regression model confirms this: `Overall Qual` had the largest coefficient (~$21,080 per quality point), indicating buyers heavily weight perceived quality.

## ii. Was simple or multiple regression better?

**Multiple regression was demonstrably better**, though with caveats:

| Metric | Simple Regression<br>(Gr Liv Area only) | Multiple Regression<br>(5 predictors) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| R² | 0.707 | **0.788** |
| Adjusted R² | — | 0.788 |
| Predictors | 1 | 5 (Gr Liv Area, Overall Qual, Garage Area, Total Bsmt SF, Year Built) |
| Interpretability | High | Moderate |

**Why multiple regression improved performance**:
- Added predictors capture complementary aspects of value: quality, functional space (basement/garage), and modernity (year built)
- The 8.1% increase in explained variance (R²: 0.707 → 0.788) is meaningful for real estate prediction

**Caveats**:
- Diminishing returns: Adding more variables beyond these 5 may yield minimal R² gains while increasing complexity
- Multicollinearity risk: `Gr Liv Area`, `Total Bsmt SF`, and `Garage Area` are correlated (all measure "size"), which can inflate standard errors

**Recommendation**: Use the multiple regression model for prediction, but consider regularization (Ridge/Lasso) if expanding the feature set to manage multicollinearity.

## iii. Were assumptions of linear regression reasonable?

Linear regression relies on four key assumptions. Here's how our model performed:

| Assumption | Diagnostic Used | Result | Reasonable? |
|------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Linearity** | Scatterplots of predictors vs. SalePrice | Generally linear trends, though some curvature visible for `Year Built` | ⚠️ Mostly |
| **Independence** | Durbin-Watson statistic = 1.500 | Slight positive autocorrelation (ideal = 2.0) | ⚠️ Marginally |
| **Homoscedasticity** | Residuals vs. Fitted plot (not shown) | Not explicitly checked; housing data often shows heteroscedasticity (variance increases with price) | ❓ Unknown |
| **Normality of residuals** | Omnibus test (p=0.000), Jarque-Bera (p=0.000), Skew=-0.601, Kurtosis=32.36 | Residuals are non-normal with heavy tails | ❌ No |

**Interpretation**:
- The non-normal residuals and high kurtosis suggest outliers and extreme values influence the model. This is common in housing data where luxury properties create a right-skewed distribution.
- The high condition number (2.28e+05) indicates multicollinearity among predictors, violating the assumption of independent predictors.

**Practical impact**: Despite assumption violations, the model remains useful for prediction. However, confidence intervals and p-values may be less reliable. Consider:
- Log-transforming `SalePrice` to reduce skew
- Using robust standard errors
- Removing extreme outliers (e.g., properties > $500K) for sensitivity analysis

## iv. What limitations exist?

### Data Limitations
1. **Missing values**: `Lot Frontage` has 490 missing entries (~17%). Dropping rows may bias results if missingness correlates with price.
2. **Temporal scope**: Data appears to reflect sales up to ~2010. Market dynamics (interest rates, remote work trends) have shifted significantly since.
3. **Geographic specificity**: Ames, Iowa is a mid-sized college town. Findings may not generalize to urban/coastal markets.

### Modeling Limitations
1. **Linear assumptions**: Housing prices often have non-linear relationships (e.g., diminishing returns on square footage). Polynomial terms or tree-based models may capture these better.
2. **Omitted variable bias**: Important factors like school district quality, walkability, or recent renovations aren't in the dataset.
3. **Multicollinearity**: Correlated size variables (`Gr Liv Area`, `Total Bsmt SF`, `Garage Area`) make individual coefficient interpretation challenging.
4. **No validation**: Without a train/test split or cross-validation, we can't assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

### Ethical & Practical Considerations
- **Fair housing**: Variables like `Neighborhood` may proxy for socioeconomic or racial factors. Use caution to avoid reinforcing bias.
- **Over-reliance on R²**: A high R² doesn't guarantee causal relationships or predictive accuracy on new data.

### Recommendations for Future Work
1. Apply log-transformation to `SalePrice` and re-evaluate assumptions
2. Implement k-fold cross-validation to estimate out-of-sample performance
3. Test non-linear models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) as benchmarks
4. Conduct feature engineering: create interaction terms (e.g., `Quality × Area`) or bin categorical variables meaningfully
5. Document business context: What is the model's intended use? (Appraisal support? Investment screening?) This guides acceptable trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability.

> **Conclusion**: The analysis successfully identifies key drivers of house prices in Ames. While linear regression provides interpretable insights, assumption violations and data limitations suggest supplementing with more robust methods for production use. The multiple regression model (R² = 0.788) offers a solid foundation for prediction, with `Overall Qual` and `Gr Liv Area` emerging as the most influential factors.
